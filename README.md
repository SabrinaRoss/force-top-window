## Force Window to Remain the Top Window

This application allows the user to choose a specific window that is currently open and prioritise it to be the topmost window, no matter now much fiddling on the gui you do.

<b>Use Case: </b>
Allows the user to do activities on one window, like having a small window in the top right corner to watch the hockey game without getting interupted by work or going below another window when opening a new window applications on top, always having to manually add it to the top afterwards (which sucks).

<b>Install Steps: </b>

pip install -r requirenments.txt <br>
python main.py
